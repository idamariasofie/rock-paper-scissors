# Rock Paper Scissors - Portfolio project 2

This is a website for playing Rock Paper Scissors, the classic game where users compete against the computer in a game of chance, with the first to 10 wins.

The aim of this project is to build an interactive front-end site which responds to the user's actions and altering the way the site displays information to achieve the user's game selections.

# **UX & Design**

As the site is a single-serving site, there is only one page. I opted to keep the design of the page simple and clean so as it doesn't distract from the main game section of the page.

### **User Stories**

- As a user, I want to be able to see the site name clearly at the top of the page.
- As a user, I want to be able to toggle the game's music on or off.
- As a user, I want to be able to access instructions on how to play the game and easily exit the instructions without disrupting the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to reset the game at any point.
- As a user, I want to be able to clearly see the game and the current state (See if I'm kicking or saving and see if I scored a goal or saved a shot).
- As a user, I want to be able to see the current score of the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to control the game using clearly labelled buttons.

##### **Wireframes**

I used Balsamiq to develop the wireframes for the website.

### **Color Scheme**

I have used  Coolors.co to create the color scheme for the website. I wanted the game to have a clean and minimalistic look. Easy to understand and to interact with.

##

### **Typography**

I used  [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)  to find the font Mauri used for all site text. I like the simple yet expressive look of this font.

## **Features**

- **Logo**

  - The site logo appears at the top of the page and shows the user the name of the game.

- **Favicon**

  - The favicon on the browser tab contains a simple hand icon, this was developed with Illustrator.

- **Game Settings Buttons**
  - The game settings buttons allows the user to read instructions and reset the game.



- **Instructions**
  - The instructions button allows the user to see the game rules and instructions on how to play.

- **Reset**
  - The reset button allows the user to reset the game at any point while playing.

- **Modal Box with instructions**

  - The instructions modal box appears when the user clicks on the instructions button and gives the user a rundown on the game's rules and controls. The box can be closed by either clicking the "Play Game" button at the bottom or clicking anywhere outside of the box without disrupting the game.

- **Game Image**

  - When entering the page this image will show to the user. The idea was to create something estetic and easy to understand.

- **Scoreboard**

  - The scoreboard displays the current score of the game clearly indicating the user's and computer's score.

- **Game Controls**

  - The game control buttons allows the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors when playing.

 These icons were found on [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)

- **Footer**

  - The footer displays that I developed the site, a link to my Github that opens in a new tab, along with the project the page is for.

### **Features Left to Implement**

- **More Direction Options**

  - I plan to add extra options to the controls which allows the user to choose top-left, top-middle, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-middle, and bottom-right.
- **More Realistic Outcomes**

  - I plan to tweak the game's logic to make it more true to a real life penalty shootout where it begins as a best out of 5 and if both sides are level after 5 kicks then it goes to sudden-death.
  -
- **Custom Characters**

  - I plan to add customization to the characters so the player can choose what colour both their character and the computer's character are.
