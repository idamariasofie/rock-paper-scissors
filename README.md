# Rock Paper Scissors - Portfolio project 2

This is a website for playing Rock Paper Scissors, the classic game where users compete against the computer in a game of chance, with the first to 10 wins. I decided to create this game and teach my four year old to play it at the same time. 

The aim of this project is to build an interactive front-end site which responds to the user's actions and altering the way the site displays information to achieve the user's game selections.

# **UX & Design**

As the site is a single-serving site, meaning there is only one page, I wanted to keep the design of the page simple and clean  Making it clear to the user visiting the website this is a game page. 

### **User Stories**

Persona 1
Age 4-15 years
One of the first games you learn as a child and young teenager. Fun to play and to learn at the same time online. 

Persona 2
Age 15-50 years
This is a person that would play this game as it reminds them of their childhood, creating a nostalic feeling. 

Persona 3
50-75 years
Since this is such a well-known game, I imagine people playing this at all ages of life.  

##### **Wireframes**

I used Balsamiq to develop the wireframes for the website. This was the original idea, a few add ons have been made when I started building the website and game, for example the game message instruction, declaring the winner of of each draw and the game. Since it made more sense to the game and made it more interactive.

### **Color Scheme**

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to create the color scheme for the website. I wanted the game to have a clean and minimalistic look. Easy to understand and to interact with.

### **Typography**

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to find the font Mauri used for all site text. I like the simple yet expressive look of this font.

- **Game Image**

  - When entering the page this image will show to the user. The idea was to create something estetic and easy to understand. I also wanted some icons that felt more "playfull" adding some fun and creativity to the game.

- **Game instructions**

- **Scoreboard**

  - The scoreboard displays the current score of the game clearly indicating the user's and computer's score. Making it easy for the user to follow along.

- **Game Controls**

  - The game control buttons allows the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors when playing. I decided to turn the rock and scissors icons horizontally to make them more true to reality. 

 These icons were found on [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
